## Sixty

**sixty** is an example of a "test the waters" website built using
GO, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, MySQL and the *Beego* web framework.
The only JS (not included in Bootstrap) was added to handle flash messages.

## Installation

First you will need to set up a database. The file *setup.sql* contains SQL to create the database and the required tables assuming you use MySQL. Beego Also supports *SQL Lite* and *Postgres*, however you will need to modify the SQL as needed.

See comments in **main.go** regarding correct database registration.

Then you can...

1. Download the .zip file.
2. Confirm that the directory below GOPATH is **src**
3. Unzip to *$GOPATH/src* (linux) or *%GOPATH%\src* (windows)
4. Rename the unzipped directory from *sixty-master* to **sixty**
5. Make required changes to *main.go* for correct database access
6. From the **sixty** directory enter **go build**
7. Assuming no errors, enter **./sixty** (linux) or **sixty** (windows)
8. In a browser go to localhost:12491/ to see the site
9. If necessary, you can change the port in *sixty/conf/app.conf*
